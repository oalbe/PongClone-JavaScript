#Pong Clone

JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas API implementation of Pong.

This is is my first attempt at writing a game. It is purely an educational exercise and not an attempt at trying to innovate the game, writing optimized code or whatnot. My main aim here is to learn software architecture in the context of game development.

I chose Pong because it has very simple mechanics and doesn't need a particularly big effort art-wise. This way I can mainly focus on learning how to organize and structure the code and apply my findings without the extra effort of dealing with sprites and textures.
